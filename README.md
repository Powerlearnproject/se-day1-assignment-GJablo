#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methodologies, and best practices to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems
- Importance;
- 1. Ensures Software Reliability and Quality- Software engineering practices help build robust, error-free, and high-performance applications
  2. Enables Scalability and Performance- Software engineers design systems that can handle large volumes of data, high traffic, and complex computations efficiently, ensuring performance remains optimal as usage increases.
  3. Improves User Experience- Software engineering focuses on usability, accessibility, and intuitive design, ensuring that applications are user-friendly, responsive, and meet customer expectations.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 – NATO Conference)- The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference held in Germany. The conference was organized to address the "software crisis", where large-scale software projects were failing due to cost overruns, delays, poor quality, and system failures
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s – 1990s)- The adoption of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by shifting from procedural programming (structured code based on functions) to a model based on objects and classes. Programming languages like C++ (1985), Java (1995), and Python (1991) embraced OOP principles, making software development more modular, reusable, and scalable.
3. The Emergence of Agile and DevOps (2001 – Present)- In response to the inefficiencies of traditional software development models (like Waterfall), Agile software development was formally introduced in the Agile Manifesto (2001). Agile emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility over rigid planning.

Later, in the 2010s, DevOps emerged as a natural evolution of Agile, promoting continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automation to enhance software delivery speed and quality


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning-  Define the scope, goals, and feasibility of the project.
2. Requirements Analysis- Gather and document user and business needs
3. Design- Create a blueprint for the software architecture.
4. Implementation (Coding & Development)- Write and compile the software code.
5. Testing-  Identify and fix defects before deployment.
6. Deployment- Release the software to end-users.
7. Maintenance & Support- Ensure long-term software performance and updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodology approach is sequential and linear while agile methodology approach is iterative and incremental
-When it comes to flexibility, waterfall is rigid, changes are difficult once a phase is completed while agile methodology, it is ighly adaptable, changes can be made at any stage
Examples;
When to use waterfall, for instance; Building a Banking System

   . Security, compliance, and structured workflows are crucial.
   . Changes in scope could disrupt system integrity.
   . Testing must be rigorous, making Waterfall’s step-by-step approach suitable.

When to use agile, for instance; Developing a Mobile App for a Startup

   . The app’s features may change based on user feedback.
   . The market is dynamic, requiring frequent updates.
   . Agile allows quick pivots to enhance user experience.

   Importance;
   - Validates Business Requirements – Ensures that the software solves the intended problem.
   - Reduces Risk of Rejections – Helps prevent costly rework after deployment.
   - Ensures Usability & Compliance – Verifies that the system meets industry and legal standards.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively interact with AI models, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Replit, to generate accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses. It involves structuring inputs to guide AI in producing desired outputs efficiently.
  Importance;
  1. Enhances AI Response Accuracy & Relevance

    Poorly structured prompts may lead to ambiguous, incomplete, or off-topic answers.
    Example:
        - Bad Prompt: "Tell me about Django."
        - Good Prompt: "Explain Django’s role in web development, including its key features and how it compares to Flask."

2️2. Optimizes AI for Specific Use Cases

  Effective prompts tailor AI responses for diverse applications such as:
        Content writing (e.g., generating blog posts)
        Coding assistance (e.g., debugging Python code)
        Data analysis (e.g., summarizing reports)
    Example:
        - Generic Prompt: "Write a Python function."
        - Specific Prompt: "Write a Python function that takes a list of expenses and returns the total monthly cost."

3️3. Improves Efficiency & Reduces Iterations

  Well-crafted prompts minimize back-and-forth interactions, saving time and computational resources.
    Example:
        Instead of repeatedly refining an AI-generated SQL query, a user can provide a detailed prompt upfront.

4️4. Facilitates AI-Assisted Creativity & Problem-Solving

  AI can assist with brainstorming ideas, generating marketing content, or solving technical problems, but only if prompted effectively.
    Example:
        Prompt for Content Creation: "Generate a LinkedIn post explaining the benefits of version control systems for software developers."
        Prompt for Coding Help: "Refactor the following Django view function to improve performance and adhere to best practices."

5️5. Enables Personalization & Context Awareness

  Context-rich prompts help AI maintain coherence and continuity, especially in multi-turn conversations.
    Example:
        Instead of: "Summarize this article," 
        use:
            "Summarize this article in 150 words, highlighting key takeaways and practical applications."

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about programming."

- Why is this prompt ineffective?

    Too broad: "Programming" covers multiple topics (languages, paradigms, tools, applications).
    No context: The AI doesn't know if the user wants a definition, history, career advice, or best practices.

- Clear, Specific, and Concise Prompt:
"Explain the key differences between Python and Java, focusing on syntax, performance, and use cases. Provide examples where each language is preferred."

- Why is this improved prompt more effective?
-> Clear Scope – The AI knows the user wants a comparison of Python and Java rather than general programming concepts.
